This is a coding exercise I am doing for the Hackerati. The program NFLstats.py sets up a local
server that takes a current NFL players name (ex: Peyton Manning) then retrieves player stats and
displays it for the user.

To use this code make sure the following Python modules are installed:
- HTML.py which can be installed from http://www.decalage.info/python/html
- urllib2

You can check to see what python modules are installed by typing help('modules') in a python shell

Run the program by typing "python NFLstats.py" (no quotes) in the command line
while in the directory with all of the files.

The following text should be displayed:
Bottle v0.11.rc1 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://localhost:8080/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.

Using a web browser, go to: http://localhost:8080/prompt

From this webpage you can enter NFL players names and retrieve data.
